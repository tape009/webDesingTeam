				<h4>Vehicular</h4>
				<p><img  src="Images/Untitled design.jpg" id="img1"class=" lefts smallPic">There are a few major ways to reduce emissions in regard to driving. Firstly, people who walk, bike, and carpool can greatly reduce their emissions.
				When walking and biking, the only emissions of carbon dioxide come from  human exhalation. Although it gives off carbon dioxide, carpooling means multiple individuals can be transported by one vehicle. 
				This means there are less cars on the road belching out greenhouse gases. Secondly, electric cars don't require gas to run when charged. This means that you can drive and release no carbon dioxide. 
				Thirdly, the avoidance of speeding and excessive acceleration can reduce emissions. When you press on the gas harder it increases the amount you burn, increasing 
				carbon cioxide emissions. Finally, avoid running your vehicle idle. It burns gas for no purpose, and releases carbon dioxide.	
				</p>

			<div class = "residential">
				<h4>Residential</h4>
				<p>There are several ways to reduce emissions in houses. To begin with, insulated houses require less electricity, which comes from burning fossil fuels, to heat or cool it.
				Also, solar power generates electricity from sunlight, so less electricity is taken from a coal burning source. Alternatively, energy efficent appliances prevent emissions because they use less electricity. 
				Finally, if a person can avoid heating or cooling their house excessively, they will use less electricity.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class = "food">
				<h4>Food</h4>
				<p>One way to reduce emissions is purchasing local or organic produce. The transportation of produce emits carbon dioxide because it is moved by trucks. The produce is often moved one state to another,
				such as Florida oranges. Another is through organic produce. Some fertilisers contain fossil fuels. Organic food is produced with no fertilisers and requires no thought on whether there are chemicals on the food.
				Another way to prevent emissions is limiting the consumption of beef and dairy products. A large portion of these products hail from rainforests that were cleared from farming. 
				This is because trees absorb carbon dioxde, and clearing out large swaths means that less of our footprint is mitigated.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class = "Miscellaneous">
				<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
				<p>To begin with, pumping less water uses less electricity. Because of this, less fossil fuel is burned to provide people with electricity. People can also buy and sell used goods. 
				This is helpful because breaking them down releases greenhouse gases, and suppliers have to burn fossil fuels to make more, to balance trashed goods. Finally, finding clean 
				energy is one of the easiest ways to limit your carbon footprint. This means you completely cut out electric companies, and they can use less fossil fuels to provide electricity.

				<h4>Extra Infomation </h4>
				<P>This video by YouTube chanllen Hot Mess gose into way to reduce carbon emission in talk about not only the step you can make as a invdeial but how socity and the rest of the world would have to change to reduces in a mainjor way. 
				it talk about how many peolpe in rerual area could not as easly ditch cars conpared to peolpe who live in city she bring up some great points how we would have to work togather to do this. she dose say we are makeing some great strides overall poelpe are eating less
				meat about 20% which is a mainjor contributer to today carbon footprint. Another point she bring up is how we are haveing less kid which can save up to 60 ton of carbon emission which show you how much carbon each person can make.   </P>
