				<h4>Vehicular</h4>
				<p>There are a few major ways to reduce emissions in regard to driving. Firstly, walking, biking, and carpooling are great ways to reduce emissions.
				If you bike or walk the only CO2 you emit is from your breath. Although it gives off CO2, if multple people ride in one vehicle it is much less 
				than each individual person driving in their own. Secondly, electric cars don't require gas to run if charged, meaning you can drive and release no CO2. 
				Thirdly, the avoidance of speeding and excessive acceleration can reduce emissions. When you press on the gas harder it increases the amount you burn, increasing 
				CO2 emissions. Finally, avoid running your vehicle idle. It burns gas for no purpose and outputs CO2 because of that.	
				</p>

				<h4>Residential</h4>
				<p>There are several ways you can reduce emissions from your own home. To begin with, insulated houses require less electricity, which comes from burning fossil fuels, to heat or cool the house.
				Also, solar power means you don't get as much electricity from a coal burning source. Alternatively, energy efficent appliances prevent emissions. The less electricity you
				use from a coal-burning source. Finally, refraining from excessive heating and cooling of your house means you use less electricity.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class = "food">
				<h4>Food</h4>
				<p>One way to reduce emissions is purchasing local or organic produce. The transportation of produce emits CO2 because it is moved by truck. The produce is often from another state a fair distance away, 
				such as Florida oranges. Another is through organic produce. Some fertilisers contain fossil fuels. Organic food is produced with no fertilisers and requires no thought on whether there are chemicals on the food.
				Another way to prevent emissions is limiting the consumption of beef and dairy products. A large portion of these products hail from rainforests that were cleared from farming. This is because trees absorb CO2, and clearing
				out large swaths means that less of our footprint is mitigated.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class = "Miscellaneous">
				<h4>Miscellaneous</h4>
				<p>To begin with, pumping less water uses less electricity. Because of this, less fossil fuel is burned to give power to people. Buying and selling used goods can also help. This is because when they break down they release greenhouse 
				gases, and suppliers have to burn fossil fuels to make more to balance trashed goods. Finally, finding clean energy is one of the easiest ways to limit your carbon footprint. This means you completely cut out electric companies, and they can use less fossil fuels to make electricity
