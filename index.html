				<h4>Causes</h4>
				<p><img  src="Images/ghg_earth.png" id="img1"class=".d-none .d-sm-block lefts">There are several causes for greenhouse gas emissions. Firstly, the respiration of organisms produces greenhouse gases. 
				Decomposing animal and plant matter also emits greenhouse gases. Deforestation reduces the ability of the environment to absorb greenhouse gases.
				Several farming practices also contribute to the emission of such gases. However, one of the larger reasons for the emission of greenhouse gases is the practice 
				of burning fossil fuels. Here are some of the most common greenhouse gasses.

			<h4>Greenhouse Gases</h4>
				<p>Change is hard, and it requires understanding what the problem is. There are many greenhouse gasses that each have a hand in global warming. 
				   Therefore, people need to know what some greenhouse gasses are and what they do. The table below lists five of the most common greenhouse gasses and a brief description about them.

						<tr>
							<th scope="row">Carbon Dioxide</th>
							 <td class="None"> <img class = "picture"  src="Images/Particle/Carbon Dioxide.png"></td>
							<td>The makeup of this gas consists of one carbon and two oxygen. This gas makes up 0.039 percent of the atmosphere.<span class="None">
								This gas is absorbed by plants,so that they can perform photosynthesis. It can last in the atmosphere for more 
								than a hundred years. When an organism exhales, carbon dioxide it emitted.</span></td>
						</tr>

							<th scope="row">Methane</th>
							<td class="None"><img class = "picture"  src="Images/Particle/Methane.png"></td>
							<td>Methane consists of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms. This gas makes up 0.00018 percent of the atmosphere. <span class="None">One 
								ton of methane has 84-87 times the impact of CO2 in the atmosphere. Due to natural processes, it only lasts about
								10 years in the atmosphere. A few ways that this gas is emitted includes by cows, landfills, and rice paddies.</span></td>

						<tr>
							<th scope="row">Water Vapor</th>
							<td class="None"><img class = "picture"  src="Images/Particle/Water.png"></td>
							<td>Water vapor is water in gaseous form. It is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.<span class="None">
								It only lasts in the atmosphere for a matter of days. Generally, water vapor is produced by natural processes and not humans.
								Water vapor holds heat in earth's atmosphere. As more heat is introduced, more water evaporates in a process called a feedback loop.
								One example of this is burning gas in an automobile engine.</span></td>
							
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th scope="row">Nitrous Oxide</th>
							<td class="None"><img class = "picture"  src="Images/Particle/Nitro.png"></td>
							<td>It is comprised of two nitrogen atoms and one one oxygen atom. This gas has an estimated potency that is 300 times greater than that of CO2.<span class="None">
								This gas also lasts for roughly a century in the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide also depletes the ozone layer. Most emissions of this gas can be 
								sourced to agricultural activities such as using synthetic fertiliser.</span></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th scope="row">Chlorofluocarbon</th>
							<td class="None"><img class = "picture"  src="Images/Particle/ChloroFlurocarbon.png"></td>
							<td>This is a compound consisting of chlorine, fluorine, and carbon, and hydrogen if its a hydrofluorocarbon. <span class="None">This compound is 
								synthetic and is of industrial origin. This gas also damages the ozone layer, which protects us from most of the sun's UV rays. In the 1930's 
								common appliances like air conditioning used toxic gases as refrigerants. The chlorofluocarbon was developed to replace the toxic refrigerants of the age.</span></td>
