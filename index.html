				<h4>Causes</h4>
					<p>There are several things that cause greenhouse gas emissions. Firstly, organism respiration produces greenhouse gases. 
					Decomposing animal and plant matter also does this. The Clearing forests reduces the ability of the environment to absorb these gases.
					Several farming practices also produce such gases. However, one of the largest reasons for the emission of such gases is the practice 
					of burning fossil fuels. Here are some of the most common greenhouse gasses.
					</p>

				<div class = "Gasses">
				<h4>Greenhouse Gases</h4>
					<p>The first gas on the list is CO2. The makeup of this gas consists of one carbon and two oxygen. This gas makes up 0.039 percent of the atmosphere. 
						This gas is absorbed by plants to perform photosynthesis. It can last in the atmosphere for more than a hundred years. One thing that causes emission 
						of CO2 is volcanic eruptions. Another greenhouse gas is Methane. Methane consists of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms. This gas makes up 0.00018 percent of the atmosphere. 
						One ton of methane has 84-87 times the impact of CO2 in the atmosphere. Methane only lasts about ten years in the atmosphere due to natural processes 
						in the air. A few ways that this gas is emitted is by cows, landfills, and rice paddies. A third greenhouse gas is water vapor. Water vapor is made up of two 
						hydrogen and one oxygen atom. This gas is the most abundant of the greenhouse variety. It only stays in the atmosphere for a matter of days. generally, water vapor is produced by natural processes and 
						not humans. The effect of water vapor is refered to as a feedback process. This means that as the earth heats up more water evaporates, and the extra water causes 
						a rise in temperature. One human cause for emissions of this gas includes the heating of water, combustion, and heating hydrogen containing substances. One example of this is
						burning gas in an automobile engine. The fourth gas on the list is Nitrous Oxide. It is comprised of two nitrogen atoms and one one oxygen atom. This gas has an 
						estimated potency 300 times that of CO2. This gas also lasts for about a century in the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide also depletes the ozone layer. Most emissions of 
						this gas can be sourced to agricultural activities such as using synthetic fertiliser. Finally there is a gas called a chlorofluocarbon. This is a compound consisting 
						of chlorine, fluorine, and carbon. If hydrogen is added it is called a hydrofluorocarbon. This compound is synthetic and is of industrial origin.
						This gas also damages the ozone layer, which protects us from most of the sun's UV rays. This gas was developed as a refrigerant to replace the current toxic ones of the 1930's.
