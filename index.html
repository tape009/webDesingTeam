				<h4>Causes</h4>
				<p><img  src="Images/ghg_earth.png" id="img1"class=".d-none .d-sm-block lefts">There are several causes for greenhouse gas emissions. Firstly, the respiration of organisms produces greenhouse gases. 
				Decomposing animal and plant matter also emits greenhouse gases. Deforestation reduces the ability of the environment to absorb greenhouse gases.
				Several farming practices also contribute to the emission of such gases. However, one of the larger reasons for the emission of greenhouse gases is the practice 
				of burning fossil fuels. Here are some of the most common greenhouse gasses.

			<div class = "Gasses">
			<h4>Greenhouse Gases</h4>
				<p>The first gas on the list is carbon dioxide. The makeup of this gas consists of one carbon and two oxygen. This gas makes up 0.039 percent of the atmosphere. 
				This gas is absorbed by plants, so that they can perform photosynthesis. It can last in the atmosphere for more than a hundred years. When an organism exhales, carbon dioxide it emitted.
				Another greenhouse gas is methane. Methane consists of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms. This gas makes up 0.00018 percent of the atmosphere. 
				One ton of methane has 84-87 times the impact of CO2 in the atmosphere. Due to natural processes, it only lasts about 10 years in the atmosphere.
				A few ways that this gas is emitted includes by cows, landfills, and rice paddies. A third greenhouse gas is water vapor. Water vapor is made up of two 
				hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. This gas is the most abundant of the greenhouse variety. It only lasts in the atmosphere for a matter of days. Generally, water vapor is produced by natural processes and 
				not humans. The effect of water vapor is refered to as a feedback process. This means that as the earth warms more water evaporates, and the extra water causes 
				a rise in temperature. Emissions of this gas come from heating of water, combustion, and heating hydrogen containing substances. One example of this is
				burning gas in an automobile engine. The fourth gas on the list is nitrous oxide. It is comprised of two nitrogen atoms and one one oxygen atom. This gas has an 
				estimated potency that is 300 times greater than that of CO2. This gas also lasts for roughly a century in the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide also depletes the ozone layer. Most emissions of 
				this gas can be sourced to agricultural activities such as using synthetic fertiliser. Finally there is a gas called a chlorofluocarbon. This is a compound consisting 
				of chlorine, fluorine, and carbon, and if hydrogen is added it is called a hydrofluorocarbon. This compound is synthetic and is of industrial origin.
				This gas also damages the ozone layer, which protects us from most of the sun's UV rays. In the 1930's common appliances like air conditioning used toxic gases as refrigerants. 
				Frigidaire, General Motors, and Du Pont developed the chlorofluocarbon to replace toxic refrigerants of the age.
